		<description>
      			<p>Distant kin of giant owls, owlfolk come in many shapes and sizes, from petite and fluffy to widewinged and majestic. Owlfolk have arms and legs like other Humanoids, as well as wings that extend from their back and shoulders.</p>
      			<p class="indent">Because of their ancestral tie to the Feywild, owlfolk can innately see the magic of their surroundings. Like owls, owlfolk are graced with feathers that make no sound when they move or fly, making it easy for them to sneak up on you in the library. Your owlfolk character might be nocturnal. Or perhaps your character is simply prone to rise later, embodying the common nickname of night owl.</p>
